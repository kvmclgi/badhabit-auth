# BadHabit

## Overview

BadHabit is an ongoing project that focuses on implementing Hardware ID (HWID) authentication and data storage using MySQL. The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust and secure system for verifying the legitimacy of the devices running the executable, and store relevant data efficiently in a MySQL database.

This README provides a high-level overview of the project, its current status, and its future objectives.

## Project Status

BadHabit is currently in its initial development phase, and it is configured to run exclusively by the project's creator. Key functionalities and goals achieved so far include:

- **HWID Authentication:** The project has integrated HWID authentication, enabling the software to identify the unique hardware ID of the device running the executable.
- **MySQL Integration:** BadHabit utilizes MySQL to store and manage data related to the software and the devices it interacts with.

## Features

While the project is still under development, here are some planned features and objectives:

- **Data Storage:** Implement data storage functionality for storing Python variables in the MySQL database securely.
- **Data Querying:** Develop a mechanism to query and retrieve data from the MySQL database for verification purposes.
- **Device Verification:** Ensure that the software can verify whether the device's HWID matches the stored HWID in the database.

## Getting Started

To use BadHabit, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required dependencies and MySQL database configurations.
3. Run the software, and it will utilize HWID authentication to interact with the MySQL database.
4. Refer to the project documentation (if available) for further details and configuration instructions.
